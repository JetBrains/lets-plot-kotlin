# Multiple Plots

## Facets

- [`facetGrid()`](%api_facet%/facet-grid.html) - split data by one or two variables that vary in the X and/or Y direction.
- [`facetWrap()`](%api_facet%/facet-wrap.html) - split data by one or more variables with extra flexibility.

Examples:

- [Multipanel plots with facets](%nb-facets%)

## `ggbunch`

- [`ggbunch`](%api_lets_plot%/ggbunch.html) - create a collection of plots that can have arbitrary location and size.

Examples:

- [Inset map of Kotlin island](%nb-spatialdataset_kotlin_isl%)
- [The `ggbunch()` function](%nb-ggbunch%)

## `gggrid`

- [`gggrid`](%api_lets_plot%/gggrid.html) - combines several plots on one figure, organized in a regular grid.

Examples:

- [The `gggrid()` function](%nb-plot_grid%)
- [Sharing X,Y-axis scale limits](%nb-gggrid_scale_share%)
