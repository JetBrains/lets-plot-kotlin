# Multiple Plots

## Facets

- [`facetGrid()`](%api_facet%/facet-grid.html) - split data by one or two variables that vary in the X and/or Y direction.
- [`facetWrap()`](%api_facet%/facet-wrap.html) - split data by one or more variables with extra flexibility.

Examples:

- [Creating multi-panel plots using facets](%nb-facets%)
- [Free scales on faceted plot](%nb-facets_free_scales%)

## `GGBunch`

- [`GGBunch`](%api_lets_plot%/-g-g-bunch/index.html) - create a collection of plots that can have arbitrary location and size.

Examples:

- [The `GGBunch` class](%nb-ggbunch%)
- [Inset map of Kotlin island](%nb-spatialdataset_kotlin_isl%)

## `gggrid`

- [`gggrid`](%api_lets_plot%/gggrid.html) - combines several plots on one figure, organized in a regular grid.

Examples:

- [The `gggrid()` function](%nb-plot_grid%)
- [Sharing X,Y-axis scale limits](%nb-gggrid_scale_share%)
