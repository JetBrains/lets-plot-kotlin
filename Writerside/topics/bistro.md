# 'bistro' Plots

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an art of looking at one or more datasets in an effort to understand the underlying structure of the data contained there.

Below are a few instruments from the 'bistro' package that could help you with your EDA investigations.


## Correlation Plot

[`CorrPlot`](%api_bistro%.corr/-corr-plot/index.html) - builder that takes a dataframe (Kotlin `Map<*, *>`) as the input and builds a correlation plot.

## Q-Q Plot

[`qqPlot`](%api_bistro%.qq/qq-plot.html) - function that creates a Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot).

## Joint Plot

[`jointPlot`](%api_bistro%.joint/joint-plot.html) - function that creates a joint plot containing bivariate and univariate graphs at the same time.
