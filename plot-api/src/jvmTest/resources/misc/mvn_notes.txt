(don't be fooled by the 2.1.0.SNAPSHOT repository, that does not matter)
Look into "Staging Repositories", check that the latest included the three artifacts (jar,source, javadocs), and "close" it
(to "close" it means that you can't add artifacts (jars) to it)
YOu should receive a mail when done.

Then, release it. One it appears in the main list, to should be sync with central Maven automatically in several hours

---------
Problem:; CLM data is not available for this artifact
(this is not to worry)
