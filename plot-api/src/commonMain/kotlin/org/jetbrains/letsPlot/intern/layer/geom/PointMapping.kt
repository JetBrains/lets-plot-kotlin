/**
 * Set of aesthetic mappings for point.
 * Aesthetic mappings describe the way that variables in the data are mapped to plot "aesthetics".
 *
 * @param x X-axis value.
 * @param y Y-axis value.
 * @param alpha Transparency level of a layer. Understands numbers between 0 and 1.
 * @param color Color of the geometry.
 *  For more info see: [aesthetics.html#color-and-fill](https://lets-plot.org/kotlin/aesthetics.html#color-and-fill).
 * @param fill Color to paint shape's inner points.
 *  Is applied only to the points of shapes having inner points.
 *  For more info see: [aesthetics.html#color-and-fill](https://lets-plot.org/kotlin/aesthetics.html#color-and-fill).
 * @param shape Shape of the point.
 *  For more info see: [aesthetics.html#point-shapes](https://lets-plot.org/kotlin/aesthetics.html#point-shapes).
 * @param size Size of the point.
 * @param stroke Width of the shape border. Applied only to the shapes having border.
 * @param angle Rotation angle of the shape, in degrees.
