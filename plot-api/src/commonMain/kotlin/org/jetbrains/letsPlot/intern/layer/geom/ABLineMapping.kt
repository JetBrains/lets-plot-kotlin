/**
 * Aesthetic mappings supported by [geomABLine()][org.jetbrains.letsPlot.geom.geomABLine].
 *
 * @param slope The line slope.
 * @param intercept The value of y at the point where the line crosses the y-axis.
 * @param alpha Transparency level of a layer.
 *  Understands numbers between 0 and 1.
 * @param color Color of the geometry.
 *  For more info see: [aesthetics.html#color-and-fill](https://lets-plot.org/kotlin/aesthetics.html#color-and-fill).
 * @param linetype Type of the line.
 *  Accept codes or names (0 = "blank", 1 = "solid", 2 = "dashed", 3 = "dotted", 4 = "dotdash", 5 = "longdash", 6 = "twodash"),
 *  a hex string (up to 8 digits for dash-gap lengths),
 *  or a pattern `offset to listOf(dash, gap, ...)` / `listOf(dash, gap, ...)`.
 *  For more info see: [aesthetics.html#line-types](https://lets-plot.org/kotlin/aesthetics.html#line-types).
 * @param size Line width.
 * @param group Identifies the group of the line.
 * @param paint_a An additional color aesthetic.
 * @param paint_b An additional color aesthetic.
 * @param paint_c An additional color aesthetic.
